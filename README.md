# Project Exam  1

## Description

This is my Project Exam 1 for the Front End programme at Noroff Fagskole.  

The aim of the site was to demonstrate my  skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript,
as well as my undestanding of the WordPress REST API. 

The content is managed with WordPress (headless) as the CMS, and I use JavaScript to dynamically populate the site.

## Built With

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript 
- WordPress REST API (headless)

## Installation

No installation needed, I have only been using vanilla variants of HTML, CSS and JS. Clone the repo, open it in VSCode and run it via Live Server to have a look around. Alternatively, go to the live site:
